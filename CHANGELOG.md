### Changed

- Production eligibility now checks the selected member's public skill level and matching Toolbelt tool type.
- Production tool eligibility follows the one-tier allowance: a T1 tool can perform T2 crafts, T2 can perform T3 crafts, and so on; tool power determines effort contributed per action.
- Public Crafts defaults to all skills while retaining the monitored settlement region as the initial region filter.
- The Production member selector now lives on the Production page instead of the sidebar.
- Public Crafts has been moved from the Production page into its own `Public Craft Finder` navigation page.
- Supply runway on Overview now uses the API run-out timestamp and displays days and hours.
- Overview treasury information now presents the treasury balance and supply upkeep without treating supply upkeep as currency expenditure.
- Overview, Structures, Research, and Region have revised operational layouts with clearer summary hierarchy.
- Member details can be opened by clicking anywhere on the member row.
- Member passive crafts now resolve recipe placeholders to item names and present grouped recent output summaries; traveler tasks are labelled Quests without the redundant level column.
- Inventory core material cards now count finished stock only and filter the visible container contents when selected.
- The former Skills page is now Professions: its primary summaries and heatmap use API-classified professions, with Adventure skills displayed separately.
- Profession heatmap headings now use full horizontal labels with wider sortable columns for readability.
- Profession summary columns have dedicated header sizing to prevent sort controls overlapping their labels.
- The Professions heatmap no longer creates an unnecessary vertical scrollbar; it scrolls horizontally only when required by the wider columns.
- Profession table columns were compacted to fit standard 1080p desktop widths without a horizontal scrollbar.
- Region now explains that the Close Settlements panel lists settlements nearest to the monitored settlement.
- Research no longer presents an active/in-progress technology because settlement technology unlocks are instant.

### Fixed

- Profession tools were incorrectly read from equipped hand slots; they are now sourced from the public Toolbelt inventory returned by the BitJita API.
- Selected-member Production cards no longer flash into a pending Toolbelt-check state during each background refresh.
- Passive craft recipe templates now resolve numbered placeholders such as tanning recipes returned as `Tan {1}`.
